##🍽️ Restaurant Ratings Dashboard:

Welcome to the Restaurant Ratings Dashboard project! This dashboard combines business intelligence (BI) insights and predictive analytics to help restaurant owners, managers, and stakeholders make data-driven decisions based on customer reviews and preferences. With the power of machine learning and a user-friendly interface, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of restaurant performance, customer satisfaction, and personalized recommendations.

##📽️ Project Overview:

This project focuses on three key areas:

📊 Dashboard Visualization:


A collection of charts, graphs, and tables that present key performance indicators (KPIs) related to restaurant ratings. This allows stakeholders to gain insights into trends, customer preferences, and restaurant performance across multiple categories (e.g., food quality, service, price range).


💡 Business Intelligence (BI) & Analytics:

Analyzing the core business objectives for restaurants, such as improving customer satisfaction and optimizing restaurant operations. BI insights help identify trends, uncover hidden correlations, and assist in strategic decision-making.


🔍 Predictive Analytics with KNN:

A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is used to predict ratings and generate personalized recommendations for users. This model provides tailored insights based on historical data, helping restaurant owners identify opportunities for improvement and customer segmentation.

##🔧 Project Structure


📊 Dashboard:

The dashboard visualizes KPIs and other metrics in real-time using dynamic charts and graphs. It provides restaurant managers with a clear understanding of performance metrics, helping to make data-driven decisions.
Key metrics include customer satisfaction rates, service quality scores, and food ratings, among others.

💡 Business Intelligence & Analytics:

This section highlights business intelligence goals, such as identifying top-performing restaurants, analyzing customer reviews, and suggesting operational improvements.
Insights derived from BI analytics are used to segment customers, analyze demographic preferences, and recommend strategies to increase customer loyalty.


🔍 Predictive Analytics:

A KNN-based predictive model is incorporated to provide personalized recommendations based on customer behavior and historical data patterns.
The algorithm predicts customer preferences for restaurant types, cuisines, and price ranges, helping owners to optimize their offerings and marketing strategies.


🌐 Welcome Page:


A landing page built with HTML provides users with easy navigation to different sections of the dashboard. This improves user accessibility and offers a friendly introduction to the dashboard's features.

##🧠 Key Features:

📊 Interactive Visualizations:

The dashboard includes interactive charts and tables that allow users to explore the data in-depth. Users can filter and segment data based on different criteria, such as cuisine types, restaurant locations, and price ranges.


💡 BI Insights:

Extract actionable insights for restaurants, including identifying best-performing cuisines, customer preferences, and areas needing improvement (e.g., service quality).

🔍 Predictive Model:

Implemented with KNN, the predictive model generates personalized restaurant recommendations for customers and helps optimize restaurant offerings.

📈 Automated Reporting:

Generate detailed reports that summarize key findings and trends for restaurant owners to quickly review and act on. This feature provides recommendations for improving customer satisfaction and enhancing restaurant performance.


⚙️ Scalability:
The dashboard is scalable, allowing restaurants of various sizes and categories to integrate their data and visualize performance in real time.
